#A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements
#the moduleâ€™s name (as a string) is available as the value of the global variable __name__
#module search path
# The directory containing the input script (or the current directory when no file is specified)
# PYTHONPATH (a list of directory names, with the same syntax as the shell variable PATH)
# The installation-dependent default (by convention including a site-packages directory, handled by the site module)

#dir() is used to find out which names a module defines
import builtins
print(dir(builtins))

## collection of modules is called as a package
#The __init__.py files are required to make Python treat directories containing the file as packages
# When importing the package, Python searches through the directories on sys.path looking for the package subdirectory
